    In this program we'll use for-loop for print numbers 1-10
    which means we don't required to write output again and again.
    for-loop will automatically do it.

/*
    For-Loop
    It consist of three parts
    for(part1;part2;part3)
    part1--> integer value which points to initial value of loop
    part2--> integer value which works as the limitation or end point of loop
    part3--> increment/decrement adding "++" with integer will increase it's value by one after every cycle
    whereas adding "--" will subtract 1 from integer.
